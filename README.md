# headphone-standing
i wanna make a headphone stand to take a break from frc cadding

# session 1:
i gotta plan this out first.
my headphones are the logitech g335.
uhm
i want it to be sort of small and compact, but not really too small i guess. i could have it hang on the table edge or it could be just sitting on the desk.
i just realised, as i looked at a bunch of other headphone stands, that they're on the table, and i'm actually not sure how i'll mount the headphone stand if it hangs off the table edge.
hmmmmmm.
i decided to pull up some dimensions of it. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80b8e3c4-1180-4eb8-a5a6-612da71ef5dc)
hmmmm yes quite interesting. 
i also want something where i could loop the cable if needed. 
i also want it to be unique in some way. 
maybe i could put the words  hack club on it
it'd be cool
hmmmm what else do i want.
i might make a pros and cons list of what is good and what is bad/ok/alright.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f01e1c97-4ba1-4379-aad6-19975337704b)
so, this one. 
pros: looks quite good, has rgb lights (instantly top tier) and quite an interesting base. it seems to also double as a charging area.
cons: i can't 3d print rgb lights, and my headphones are wired, so charging isn't needed

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9023b597-7f9a-4ca3-ac08-03fa34c9a921)
pros: it looks sturdy, has a hook coming out of it to hold the headphones and has a thing at the back that you can coil the wire around.
cons: ~~can't 3d print wood~~ i don't have any cons for it (but that doesn't meant that it's top tier)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2967c97b-79a8-45f5-a62a-efb23f23e8be)
pros: it seems to be quite basic. it has something lining the area between the 2 plates (i think some metal) and a good base
cons: the area to hold the heapdhones is quite large, and in my opinion a bit uneccessary to leave that much space.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5c74e5b-e0b1-48b0-a7a5-a78f8b236be0)
pros: this is quite interesting. it has a space for the ear cups/ear pads/ i don't know what to call them. it has an interesting base
cons: requires lots of supports to make (i hate supports) 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd49e9df-05e0-4fc6-96b7-7438be4337d5)
pros: quite minimalistic, just the base, a rod/pole/cylinder and the part to hold up the headphones
cons: ~~quite minimalistic~~ it's alright.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16391a21-dc38-4cd4-88e8-28978fba0089)
pros: it's just a hook, quite simple and you can store it on a place that isn't your desk, meaning that you can free up desk space which is a precious thing to me.
cons: needs to be secured rigidly to the table or the wall (i can see a piece of 3M double sided tape or something on the top, so i assume that it has to be secured to the table)

I think that i could maybe make a headphone stand that hangs off of the table, without using any tape, but i'm not entirely sure how to do it just yet. 

# session 2:
hmmmmmmm
i think i'm going to search for headphone stands that mount onto the table, and rate them.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc3b9126-cfbb-421f-9ab0-ce1f463a6201)
this one is quite interesting, but it needs something to help it secure it to the table
pros: holds the headphones, and can possibly hold 2.
cons: needs nails or screws or something to help hold it up.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929aa047-2d99-4b5e-918e-8d1ba6db874d)
pros: holds headphones
cons: needs things ot help secure to the table.

THIS IS WHAT I NEED.
ok so
from what i can tell, it's basically 2 plates sandwiching the table, and it has the headphones stowed directly underneath, so that the center of mass doesn't go wack. 
hmmmmm i think i can adapt this. 
i think i want it to face towards the front, so i don't have to push the headhpones away from me to get it off the stand. 
the further and further i scroll down the images, the more examples that i see that are exactly what i described.

hmmmmm ok. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12fbb076-06cc-48ed-bdc2-8631830aac89)
this is the side view that i've come up with. the slope at the hook is to make it even easier to slide the headphones off of the stand. 
i think i migth make a bunch of things configurable.

aw mannnn
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ac00ec9-ffc5-43a9-a560-a8d7aba89721)
i've made some configurations for the hook and the thickness of the table. now, i need to somehow be able to adjust the size of the part that supports the hook. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b1e1a0d-75dd-4473-9d25-a22033f86da4)
i think this feels overkill now, after looking at a ruler. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4ff8c52-a13c-4394-a0af-228b556022dc)
i think this works?
i also want to make a wire spool that looks like a 3d printer filament spool, although i also want it to be easy to take the wire off of the spool easily. 
hmmmmm
should i mount it above the headphone or below...
i think mounting it above could limit the space that you can reach on the desk and stuff, also it could be hard to reach it, since the wire is at the bottom of the headphone, not at the top. 
i think i'm mounting it below.

hmmmmmmmmm
i think i wanna change some things. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72d2f5fa-a28c-42ec-896f-3e70b6dc248e)
ooo i think that's good. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6e4c7a5-73b1-46aa-bf24-ffaef305f5ec)
i might extend the back area out. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48020c21-bcf0-4d82-a33a-a36a3ffd4f83)
hmmm ok i think i wanna change some things. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55099db1-d506-4075-85f2-5cd05c761b44)
the headphone spool is large compared to the size of the headphone stand. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd076829-49f7-4b9f-908d-35fe89f3e3af)
ok cool.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ad6a664-2b90-4ac1-9930-0ea38410b04b)
it might be still a bit large compared to the headphone stand, but it might be fine. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68b14cb5-1a38-4652-8771-08d81887bdce)
i just realised that it might not be possible for this to be 3d printed on a regular size plate/the bambu lab a1 mini plate. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ce438fd-d163-4e23-918b-0fbb735cb3bd)
that might be good enough. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/107f6dca-4653-4354-9c8b-f4ecb03a47cb)
hmmmmmmm
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2d0094c-2ef5-4e00-a9bc-be6a95b76d2c)
that doesn't look tooo good. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c4a1e79-4d81-462b-9986-6278c45f4656)
this could work, but the main problem is that the gap is too small to put a headphone jack through. 
hmmksamfdklasjdfask;jfa;slkjdfasjfkd

# session 3:
i have to find the right balance between the size of the wire spool and the size of the gaps for the headphone jack. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/891e2fc3-a220-4877-9562-ae3e2bc52a4c)
i put a hole through the middle to make it look more like a 3d printer spool.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/256e8656-1ae2-4210-9f7f-a2ceb7f80d08)
i tried to use an isogrid pattern to make it look cooler, didn't really work out.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/819cb5c3-8931-40a5-b84a-8c1d496093f9)
ooo this looks good. 
the only problem is that i can't select 2 faces at once, so i have to use 2 different cheeseits.
honestly i might just keep it as is. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a3d0ef6-b132-4ea7-985e-e3707c3ccc6a)
this looks nice but it cuts through the bottom. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e273e40d-ad81-4bfa-9738-4bd85b0861f5)
with most of the headphone stand having patterns, the top half looks a bit out of place. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59304919-48f9-48d6-aefb-25fa5b7b2af7)
i used patchit to fix the problem, which was that there was a pocket in the top half, which prevented the rest of the top half to be pocketed/patterned. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78bdc016-ebee-4f76-95c1-148620699fbe)
hmmm it just doesn't work. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca351666-f4d2-4a42-bb93-6ef278241df4)
you may notice that the fillet is smaller on the top half, which is because cheeseit doesn't allow me to use a 2 mm radius fillet/tool radius.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a237a747-3487-49d9-977c-14ddf0ecff95)
hmmm this doesn't look entirely good. i really want the pocketing but it also makes other things look scuffed. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/432bd758-f857-4d45-8717-0131b0b1726d)
i decided to just leave a bit of room in the back
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa9b8673-23b3-4e84-bf64-89e5423af454)
one might say that i;m going overboard with the pocketing. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df7e34eb-3173-42ee-8ba3-eb4625bbb57d)
i was also able to swap back to a 2mm tool radius/fillet, but it doesn't really matter too much, as you can't really machine this anyways, and i plan for this to be 3d printable. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f5d2abf-d0fa-4dff-b4af-3e10e5ab136a)
i am NOT pocketing the bottom layer. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96888fc7-74c1-4016-94ff-aa9c17a1a1ee)
instead of making the 3d printer spool pattern myself i wondered if i could use the cheeseit
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9dea842-64e9-4a13-bd5e-7c63ea853019)
uh...
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e02cf61-dfee-40c7-b9b4-0b6d4f56a74f)
ok i'm just going to use hexagons. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/704bdbe2-5a4d-43d9-9c5f-768aced9c679)
that's not bad from the back.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7cde5fc-1126-4ed3-a52b-04e6104def9e)
damn that's good.
i think it's pretty much done
i think i might make more headphone stands, ~~so i can stay away from frc cad for longer~~ so i can cater to people who don't have a lot of space underneath their desk (aka my brother, even though he already has a headphone stand that is like a wooden hand that he can change the bending of the fingers to hold his headphones which is from ikea
![Uploading image.png…]()
)
i might make several different designs for above-desk headphone stands
idk what i want to make though.
