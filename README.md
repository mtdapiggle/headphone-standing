# headphone-standing
i wanna make a headphone stand to take a break from frc cadding

# session 1:
i gotta plan this out first.
my headphones are the logitech g335.
uhm
i want it to be sort of small and compact, but not really too small i guess. i could have it hang on the table edge or it could be just sitting on the desk.
i just realised, as i looked at a bunch of other headphone stands, that they're on the table, and i'm actually not sure how i'll mount the headphone stand if it hangs off the table edge.
hmmmmmm.
i decided to pull up some dimensions of it.

hmmmm yes quite interesting. 
i also want something where i could loop the cable if needed. 
i also want it to be unique in some way. 
maybe i could put the words  hack club on it
it'd be cool
hmmmm what else do i want.
i might make a pros and cons list of what is good and what is bad/ok/alright.

so, this one. 
pros: looks quite good, has rgb lights (instantly top tier) and quite an interesting base. it seems to also double as a charging area.
cons: i can't 3d print rgb lights, and my headphones are wired, so charging isn't needed

pros: it looks sturdy, has a hook coming out of it to hold the headphones and has a thing at the back that you can coil the wire around.
cons: ~~can't 3d print wood~~ i don't have any cons for it (but that doesn't meant that it's top tier)

pros: it seems to be quite basic. it has something lining the area between the 2 plates (i think some metal) and a good base
cons: the area to hold the heapdhones is quite large, and in my opinion a bit uneccessary to leave that much space.

pros: this is quite interesting. it has a space for the ear cups/ear pads/ i don't know what to call them. it has an interesting base
cons: requires lots of supports to make (i hate supports)

pros: quite minimalistic, just the base, a rod/pole/cylinder and the part to hold up the headphones
cons: ~~quite minimalistic~~ it's alright.

pros: it's just a hook, quite simple and you can store it on a place that isn't your desk, meaning that you can free up desk space which is a precious thing to me.
cons: needs to be secured rigidly to the table or the wall (i can see a piece of 3M double sided tape or something on the top, so i assume that it has to be secured to the table)

I think that i could maybe make a headphone stand that hangs off of the table, without using any tape, but i'm not entirely sure how to do it just yet.
